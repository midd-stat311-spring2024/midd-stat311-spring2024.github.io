    "text": "Midterm 2\nMidterm 2 will feature both an in-person component and a take-home component. Some aspects of the take-home component will require R, whereas the in-person part will not.\nMaterial through the end of Week 8 (up to and including MGFs) is fair game for this midterm. The exam will be lightly cumulative, but with emphasis on material covered since the first midterm.\nThe grading will be as follows: score on in-person component + score on take-home = final score on Midterm 2.\n\nI will host a review session on Sunday, 11/12 from 3-5pm in Warner 105!\n\nPractice problems here! Solutions will be posted beginning of Week 10.\nUpdate 11/09/23: I accidentally included a problem that requires topics we have not covered yet. I have now removed it from the practice problems.\n\nIn-person component\n6-8 pm on Thursday, 11/16/23 in Warner 104\nFormat and Resources\n\nYou are allowed one, double-sided 8.5x11 cheat sheet.\n\nYou may write definitions, theorems, properties, distributions, and other “factual” type of information. You are not allowed to write any worked out examples or problems.\nYou should write down all of the PMFs/PDFs for the “common” distributions, along with expected values, variances, MGFs, and CDFs if we have learned them or seen them in the textbook\nThe cheat sheet will be submitted alongside your midterm.\n\nQuestions on the in-class exam will be similar in difficulty and scope to questions from both Daily Assignments and Class Activities.\n\n\n\nTake-home component\nAvailable from 8:00am on Friday, 11/17/23 through 11:59pm on Sunday, 11/19/23.\nWe will not have class on Friday, 11/17/23.\n\nThe take-home is assigned in such a way to give flexibility in travel and so you can fully enjoy your Thanksgiving break starting at 2pm on Friday (if you so choose). Therefore, I hope that some of you use the usual class time to work on the take-home.\n\nFormat\n\nThe take-home will be made available on Canvas. You will have 3 hours from opening the assignment to complete the take-home component of the midterm.\n\nIt is your responsibility to make sure that everything is uploaded in time.\nYour solutions should be neatly written or typed. If you scan a handwritten assignment, be sure to review the legibility of your scan and upload before you submit your assignment.\n\nQuestions on the take-home exam will be similar in difficulty and scope to questions on homework.\n\nResources\n\nYou should e-mail Prof. Tang with clarifying questions only! I will do my best to answer within a few hours of you sending the email, but you should expect a longer wait if you send an email between the hours of 8pm and 8am.\nYou may use any notes you’ve taken for this class, your work on any previous homework, in-class, and daily assignments, any solutions posted to the course Canvas site, comments you’ve received on homework or assignments through Canvas, and Blitzstein’s textbook/videos.\nYou may not use any other resources other than those listed above. You may not seek answers to exam questions online or ChatGPT, or in other textbooks, and may not work with others on the exam.\n\n\n\nRevisions\nThere is an opportunity to earn points back on the second midterm, but if you take advantage of the opportunity, there is the potential of receiving an overall lower score on the midterm. Details:\n\nFrom 12/11 at 5:00 pm - 12/13 11:59pm, new problems will be made available via Canvas quiz. Upon starting the quiz, will have 60 minutes to submit your solutions.\n\nResources for the revision are the same as the resources for the take-home component (see above).\n\nYour updated Midterm 2 score will be a weighted average of your original midterm 2 score and your score on the new problem(s): \\[\\text{new score} = 0.8(\\text{original score}) + 0.2(\\text{revision score})\\]\n\nDepending on how you do on the revision, your new score may be lower than the original. See this figure:\n\n\n\nFind your original score on the x-axis. Then based on how you do on the revision problem (colors), you can find your updated score (y-axis).\n\n\n\nYou are welcome to “start” the quiz on Canvas and decide to not finish it. I will only grade and update scores for those who submit a solution to the quiz."

Note that some of these problems are more difficult than I would expect you to be able to do on the final. Practicing on harder problems means you’ll be better prepared for the actual final!\n\nI will also be having office hours on Tuesday, 12/12 from 11:00am-12:00pm, then from 3:30-4:30pm.\n\nResources\n\nYou are allowed one, double-sided 8.5x11 cheat sheet.\n\nYou may write definitions, theorems, properties, distributions, and other “factual” type of information.

Thanks Thomas for reminding me! Note that expectation and variance are not provided for it…\n\nFormulas for MGFs or CDFs will not be provided on this distribution sheet.\nYou are welcome to write the formulas for other distributions you have encountered in this course on your note sheet."
