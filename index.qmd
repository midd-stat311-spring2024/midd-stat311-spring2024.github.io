## Major Announcements

-   **Midterm 1 (non-R) revisions** (due physically in class Tuesday, 04/09):
    -   For partial credit back, you are welcome to revise any and all parts in which you received less than 50%. My expectation is that for every part you revise, you should completely re-write a new solution.
        -   This may also require you to revise previous parts of problems in which you received more then 50% credit but not full 100%. If this is the case, please include this work in your revision as well.
    -   Tempting as it may be, try not work with others/ask each other how you did certain parts.
-   [Final project](project.qmd) announced. Take a look at the description!
-   New office hours schedule as follows:
    -   Mondays 2:00-4:00pm (starting on 04/15)
    -   Tuesdays 10:45am-12:00pm (as usual)
    -   However, I'm travelling this coming Monday 4/08, so I will extend due date of Homework 6 to Wednesday 04/10 and have the following make-up office hours:
        -   Friday 04/05 from 10:45am-11:45am
        -   Wednesday 04/10 from 3:30-4:30pm
