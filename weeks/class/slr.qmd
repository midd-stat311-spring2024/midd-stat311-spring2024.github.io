# Data

```{r warning = F, message = F}
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
```

Elections for the U.S. House of Representatives take place every two years. Half coincide with presidential elections, and the other half take place in the middle of a Presidential term. These are called the midterm elections. The data `midterms_house` from the `openintro` package contains data from the 29 midterm elections between 1899-2019.

One political theory suggests that high unemployment rate corresponds to worse performance by the Presidentâ€™s party in midterm elections. Let's examine that here! The two variables we will consider in the following data are:

-   `unemp`: the unemployment rate in the year of the midterm election

-   `house_change`: percent change in the House seats for the sitting president's party

```{r}
dat <- midterms_house %>%
  filter(!year %in% c(1935, 1939)) # filter out Depression Era


```

# Simple Linear Regression

If we're interested in understanding how `house_change` is related to `unemp`, we might consider a simple linear regression model of the form:

$$\text{housechange} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \text{unemp} + \epsilon$$
One big assumption is that the response variable is Normal:

```{r}
hist(dat$house_change, xlab = "Percent change", main = "Histogram of midterm election changeover")
```

Do this look Normal? Not so sure... But we will proceed anyway! 

## Point estimates 

```{r}
n <- nrow(dat)
y <- dat$house_change
ybar <- mean(y)
x <- dat$unemp
xbar <- mean(x)
s_x2 <- sum((x - xbar)^2)
b1_hat <- sum((y - ybar)*(x - xbar))/s_x2
b0_hat <- ybar - b1_hat * xbar
s2_hat <- (1/n)*sum((y - (b0_hat + b1_hat*x))^2)
b0_hat
b1_hat
s2_hat
```

## Inference

### Hypothesis test

We might want to better understand if unemployment rate really is associated with changes in composition of the House seats. Consider the hypotheses

$$H_{0}: \beta_{1} = 0 \qquad \text{vs.} \qquad H_{1}: \beta_{1} \neq 0$$
Let $U = s_{x}\left(\frac{\hat{\beta}_{1} - 0}{\sigma'}\right)$. Recall our rejection rule for a level $\alpha_{0}$ test of these hypotheses is to reject $H_{0}$ if $|U| \geq c = T^{-1}_{n-2}(1 - \frac{\alpha_{0}}{2})$. In particular, consider $\alpha_{0} = 0.05$:

```{r}
s_tilde <- sqrt(n*s2_hat/(n-2))
u <- sqrt(s_x2)*(b1_hat - 0)/s_tilde
u

# level-05 test rejection rule
alpha0 <- 0.05
c <- qt(1 - alpha0/2, n-2)
c
```

Since $|U| = |u| = `r abs(round(u, 3))`$ is less than $c = `r round(c, 3)`$, we fail to reject $H_{0}$. So we cannot conclude that there is a linear association between unemployment rate and the percent change in house representatives from the president's party during midterm elections.

### p-value

We can also obtain the p-value and compare its value to $0.05$

```{r}
# p-value
pt(-abs(u), n-2) + pt(abs(u), n-2, lower.tail = F)
```

Since the p-value is greater than $0.05$, we fail to reject $H_{0}$ at the 0.05 level.


### `lm()` function

We can easily obtain these results using the `lm()` function below. Notice how the outputs from this function compare to the values we obtained by hand!

```{r}
mod <- lm(house_change ~ unemp, data = dat)
summary(mod)
```
