```{r eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
# change the file path if needed
x <- readRDS("~/Downloads/normal_mixture_data.Rda")
data.frame(x = x) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x= x))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 15)
```

## Create function for E-Step

```{r eval = FALSE}
# x = observed data
# n = number of observations
# m = number of mixture components
# mu = m-vector of means mu
# p = m-vector of component proportions
e.step <- function(x, n, m, mu, p){
 
}
```

## EM algorithm

```{r eval = FALSE}
# set m and n


# number of iterations until convergence; depends on the problem!

# initialize


# create matrices for storing iterations

# Run algorithm

for(s in 2:___){
  # E-step
  
  # M-step and update in one go

  
  # store to monitor convergence

  
}
```

### Asses convergence

```{r}
# assess convergence by looking at the last few iterations

```
