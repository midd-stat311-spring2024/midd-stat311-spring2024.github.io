**Project proposals due tomorrow at 12:00pm to Canvas!**

**Material through today is fair game for Midterm II! (**Though next week's material is a lot of practice applying hypothesis testing ideas to a specific set of data.)

**Topics**

-   LRT asymptotics
-   Equivalence of Confidence Sets and Hypothesis Tests

**Daily assignment**

-   Nothing official, but be prepared to answer the following:
    -   Suppose $X_{1},\ldots, X_{n} \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are both unknown. Letting $\alpha_{0} \in (0,1)$, find the bounds of an equal-tailed $(1-\alpha_{0})$ coefficient confidence interval for $\mu$. *You should be able to look through your notes to answer this one!*
