**Topics**

-   Equivalence of Confidence Sets and Hypothesis Tests

**Daily assignment**

-   Nothing official, but be prepared to answer the following:
    -   Suppose $X_{1},\ldots, X_{n} \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ where $\mu$ is unknown and $\sigma^2$ is known. Letting $\alpha_{0} \in (0,1)$, find the bounds of an equal-tailed $(1-\alpha_{0})$ coefficient confidence interval for $\mu$. *You should be able to look through your notes to answer this one!*
